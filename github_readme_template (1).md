# Workplace Research Project

## Overview
This project investigates what questions software developers are asking in workplace contexts using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

## Research Question
What are the primary topics and themes in questions asked by software developers in professional settings?

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: [Briefly describe your dataset]
- **Topic Modeling**: Implemented using Mallet and Gensim
- **Analysis**: [Key analytical approaches]

## Key Findings
[Add 2-3 bullet points about what you discovered]

## Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Mallet (topic modeling), Gensim (NLP), [others you used]
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
